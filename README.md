Sequence (PHP Version)
======================

> Plugin based web framework with message passing.

## Overview

This is the previous edition of Sequence. This was never quite finished,
and is currently being rewritten in Rust. This will continue to be kept
around and used simultaneously until the new edition supports this
edition's template capabilities.
